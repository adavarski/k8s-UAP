And the lead character is also named Woody https://t.co/ZxK84rB020. @NotEricRalph @MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines. @TTownJoe @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Conservation of energy tells you the answer. @Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!. @MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don‚Äôt need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.. @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table. @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq. @torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in ‚àÜv equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU. @HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon.

Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq. @HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.. @neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren‚Äôt aware that orbit (and ‚Äúzero‚Äù gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.. @NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand.

Will be smooth as silk.. @wk057 @Tesla Should be much better at this point. Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts. @brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry ‚Ä¶. @bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.. Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid. V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.. @cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.. @tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too.

If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ‚Ä¶ haha. @MoWo91 @SpX_memes @SpaceX @Tesla @RenataKonkoly @sara_boutall @Kristennetten @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @JohnnaCrider1 ü§£ü§£. @flcnhvy I have V1, but will switch to V3.

Anyone who‚Äôs interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing ‚Äî designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine ‚Äî please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We‚Äôre gonna take this to a whole new level!. @Erdayastronaut Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I‚Äôm in awe.. So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It‚Äôs insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you ‚Ä¶. @RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I‚Äôve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.. @RationalEtienne @LaurenRow5 @EvaFoxU @JohnnaCrider1 @Kristennetten @vincent13031925 @28delayslater @Sofiaan @hamids @InsideEVs Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard. And the lead character is also named Woody  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don‚Äôt need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.. @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table. @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ‚àÜv equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ‚Äôre working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren‚Äôt actual parking spaces.. @Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted Yeah, great team!. @J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth.  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ‚Äôt aware that orbit (and ‚Äúzero‚Äù gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.. @NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly ‚Ä¶. @annerajb @tesla_addicted Software. @SteveMartineau6 @annerajb @YogiSC1127 @Tesla Yes. @tesla_addicted Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon. @flcnhvy @aquastorm Venus would be very difficult. @tesla_truth @annerajb @YogiSC1127 @Tesla True. @aquastorm Yes, we will. @annerajb @YogiSC1127 @Tesla It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers.. @YogiSC1127 @Tesla Deep Rain‚Ñ¢Ô∏è neural net coming soon. We‚Äôre not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep.. @nate_mccomb @28delayslater @Charalanahzard Yep, good catch. @teslaownersSV @28delayslater @Charalanahzard ‚ô•Ô∏è hot pot. @28delayslater @Charalanahzard Cybertruck doesn‚Äôt look like anything I‚Äôve seen bouncing around the Internet.

Is Space Jam good?. @Nobody_Really7 @anonyx10 @mayemusk So it goes. @anonyx10 @mayemusk Sure looks that way. @owlmaster08 @Tesla Nice ü§£ü§£. @Erdayastronaut Solar. @Erdayastronaut Depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess. @bonnienorman Whoa, that does look good!. @Macwars Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.. French fries üçü are the devil üòà  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ~10% to help those affected by blackouts. @brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry ‚Ä¶. @bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.. Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid. V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.. @cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.. @tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that‚Äôs problematic above ~30 deg latitude.. @wilsonlam üòâ. @annerajb @Thebault_Arthur Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.. @Thebault_Arthur Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there‚Äôs a delay. Other countries are supportive.. Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1.
