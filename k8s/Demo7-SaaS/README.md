Note: JupyterLab, brings a robust and extendable suite of data science capabilities along with a command-line terminal. Operating JupyterLab within the cluster creates an incredibly efficient environment for both traditional data science, analytics, and experimentation, along with opportunities for development and operations through closer interaction with the Kubernetes API.

The following sections demonstrate the setup of a Kubernetes Namespace, sample RBAC, and ServiceAccount permissions allowing JupyterLab access to Kubernetes resources. JupyterHub is configured to provision JupyterLab environments(Spark driver with jupyter inside + spark workers/executors we can run via SparkSession), authenticating against Keycloak. So SaaS is based on JupyterHub/Lab.

Notes:

JupyterHub (per user/tenant) snip:
```
singleuser:
  image:
    name: davarski/spark301-k8s-minio-jupyter
    tag: 2.0.0
  defaultUrl: "/lab"
```


Example Notebook(snip):

(Ref: Demo6:  https://github.com/adavarski/k8s-UAP/tree/main/k8s/Demo6-Spark-ML : using spark driver pod and running 2 spark workers and Spark using k8s as Cluster Manager)

```
import pyspark

conf = pyspark.SparkConf()

# Kubernetes is a Spark master in our setup. 
# It creates pods with Spark workers, orchestrates those 
# workers and returns final results to the Spark driver 
# (“k8s://https://” is NOT a typo, this is how Spark knows the “provider” type). 
conf.setMaster("k8s://https://kubernetes.default:443") 

# Worker pods are created from the base Spark docker image.
# If you use another image, specify its name instead.
conf.set(
    "spark.kubernetes.container.image", 
    "davarski/spark301-k8s-minio-base:1.0.0") 

# Authentication certificate and token (required to create worker pods):
conf.set(
    "spark.kubernetes.authenticate.caCertFile", 
    "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt")
conf.set(
    "spark.kubernetes.authenticate.oauthTokenFile", 
    "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token")

# Service account which should be used for the driver
conf.set(
    "spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName", 
    "spark-driver") 

# 2 pods/workers will be created. Can be expanded for larger workloads.
conf.set("spark.executor.instances", "2") 

# The DNS alias for the Spark driver. Required by executors to report status.
conf.set(
    "spark.driver.host", "spark-jupyter") 

# Port which the Spark shell should bind to and to which executors will report progress
conf.set("spark.driver.port", "29413") 

# Initialize spark context, create executors
sc = pyspark.SparkContext(conf=conf)

sc._conf.getAll()

!kubectl get pod

# Create a distributed data set to test to the session
t = sc.parallelize(range(10))

# Calculate the approximate sum of values in the dataset
r = t.sumApprox(3)
print('Approximate sum: %s' % r)
```


### Keycloak

Keycloak is a free, open source identity and access management application sponsored by Red Hat. Keycloak provides the ability to create and manage user accounts, or connect to an existing LDAP or Active Directory. Third-party applications may authenticate users through OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0.

Keycloak provides a turnkey solution for identity management and third-party authentication well suited to the requirements of the SaaS  data platform. The following section implements a single-node Keycloak instance, used later for JupyterHub to authenticate users before provisioning JupyterLab instances for them.

```
kubectl apply -f ../003-data/9000-keycloak/10-service.yml
kubectl apply -f ../003-data/9000-keycloak/15-secret.yml
kubectl apply -f ../003-data/9000-keycloak/30-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f ../003-data/9000-keycloak/50-ingress.yml
```

Realm, Client, and User

Keycloak provides identity management and authentication to multiple tenants through the configuration of realms. JupyterHub is configured later to authenticate users using Oauth2, belonging to the realm "saas". A Keycloak client associated with a realm grants access to applications such as JupyterHub looking to authenticate users. This section sets up a realm, client, and user used to provision JupyterLab servers later. Using a web browser, visit the new Ingress https://auth.data.davar.com/auth/ as set up via yaml manifests. Log in to Keycloak using the "sysop" credential defined in /9000-keycloak/15-secret.yml . After logging in, master is the default realm shown in the upper left of the user interface and depicted bellow:

<img src="https://github.com/adavarski/k8s-UAP/blob/main/k8s/Demo7-SaaS/pictures/SaaS-Keycloack-add-realm-saas.png" width="800">

Open the "Add realm" menu by clicking the drop-down to the right of the realm title and create the new realm "saas".


Next, navigate to Clients in the left-hand navigation of the new Datalab realm. Click Create and fill in the “Add Client” form to add a new client named "saas" shown bellow:

<img src="https://github.com/adavarski/k8s-UAP/blob/main/k8s/Demo7-SaaS/pictures/SaaS-Keycloack-add-client-to-realm-saas.png" width="800">

After adding the new "saas" client, click the Credentials tab to retrieve the generated secret, as shown:

<img src="https://github.com/adavarski/k8s-UAP/blob/main/k8s/Demo7-SaaS/pictures/SaaS-Keycloack-client-credentilals.png" width="800">


JupyterHub is later configured to use the client ID "saas" and the generated secret for permission to authenticate users against the Keycloak "saas" realm.


Configure the new "saas" client (under the Setting tab) by switching Authorization Enabled to on. Provide Valid Redirect URIs, in this case,
https://saas.data.davar.com/hub/oauth_callback later defined in the “JupyterHub” section. Review:

<img src="https://github.com/adavarski/k8s-UAP/blob/main/k8s/Demo7-SaaS/pictures/SaaS-Keycloack-client-config-url-auth-enabled.png" width="800">


Finally, create one or more users in the "saas" realm by choosing Users under the Manage section of the left-hand menu. After adding a user, assign a password under the Credentials tab. Use a strong password; any users assigned to this realm are later given access to a JupyterLab environment with permissions to read and write data and execute code from within the cluster.

### SaaS Namespace

Note: Use Kubernetes ResourceQuota objects for fine-grain restriction to resources for a given Namespace, including the total number of Pods and PersistentVolumeClaims allowed, CPU, memory, and storage class restrictions.

This section sets up the Namespace "saas" along with a ServiceAccount and RBAC permissions used by JupyterLab and JupyterHub.

The default service account assigned to Pods in this cluster does not have access to the Kubernetes API. The following creates a service account assigned to JupyterLab Pods provisioned by JupyterHub.

```
kubectl apply -f ../003-data/8000-saas-namespace/00-namespace.yml
kubectl apply -f ../003-data/8000-saas-namespace/05-serviceaccount.yml
kubectl apply -f ../003-data/8000-saas-namespace/07-role.yml
kubectl apply -f ../003-data/8000-saas-namespace/08-rolebinding.yml

```
      
### JupyterHub

JupyterHub “spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server.” 21 This section installs JupyterHub
into the development cluster and configures it to authenticate users with Keycloak and spawn JupyterLab (notebook with spark driver preinstalled) servers into the "saas" Namespace. Additionally, the "saas" Role defined in the previous section grants JupyterHub limited access to the Kubernetes API.

JupyterHub (along with Keycloak) for use as a multi-tenant(SaaS users/tenants) provisioner of JupyterLab (Spark clusters) environments managing one or more Jupyter Notebooks.

values.yml file:

- Within the proxy section, set the secretToken to a 32-character string of random hex values. The official documentation recommends using the following command:

```
$ openssl rand -hex 32
```

- Within the singleuser section, note the container image davarski/spark301-k8s-minio-jupyter(JupyterLab image). A variety of Jupyter Notebook images may be used here; however, in this case, the specified image represents a highly customized version developed (with Spark and needed libs)


- Within the hub section, extraConfig is used to inject additional configuration not directly exposed by the Helm chart. In this case, the configuration instructs KubeSpawner to spawn JupyterLab Pods in the "saas" Namespace and configured to use the "saas" ServiceAccount defined earlier.

Additionally, within the hub section, extraEnv is used to populate environment variables required by the GenericOAuthenticator defined later in values.yml. Note the Keycloak realm "saas", created earlier and defined in the environment variables OAUTH2_AUTHORIZE_URL and OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL.

-Within the auth section, the GenericOAuthenticator is configured with a client_id and client_secret set up earlier in the Keycloak "saas" realm. Note the "saas" realm is part of the token_url and userdata_url paths.

```
$ helm repo add jupyterhub https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart/
   
$ helm repo update
$ cd ../003-data/10000-jupterhub
# Install (or upgrade/update) the JupyterHub Helm package.
$ helm upgrade --install saas-hub jupyterhub/jupyterhub --namespace="data" --version="0.9-dcde99a" --values="values.yml"
```
JupyterHub is configured to run in the cluster and in the Namespace data and configured to spawn single-user JupyterLab servers (Pods) in the "saas" namespace. After applying configuration JupyterHub may take several minutes to boot as it must preload large JupyterLab images. Once JupyterHub has fully booted, launch a new JupyterLab instance (with a user created in Keycloak under the datalab realm) by visiting https://saas.data.davar.com.

### JupyterLab
JupyterLab is “the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter,” a feature-rich data science environment. Project Jupyter began in 2014 and has seen massive adoption; 

Jupyter Notebooks are a browser-based (or web-based) IDE.

Kubernetes is a natural fit for provisioning and serving JupyterLab environments through JupyterHub, as demonstrated in the previous section. Streamlining the development of machine learning and statistical models has driven the success of Project Jupyter. Many data science activities, such as machine learning, require static, immutable data sets to achieve reproducible results from experimentation. However, operating Jupyter environments with static data alongside real-time event streams, indexes, and the full power of Kubernetes distributed computing is an opportunity to offer a variety of data science functionality directly in the center of a data platform. The following sections demonstrate brief examples of working directly with the data and control plane from within the k8s cluster, connecting JupyterLab notebooks (Spark cluster) with k8s MinIO, Hive, etc. SaaS services
